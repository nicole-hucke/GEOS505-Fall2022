## Research: 
My research consists on studying the relationship between the onset of sediment motion and nutrient cycling. I look at the variations of critical shear stress in a mountain stream in New Mexico and take water samples through high flow events to evaluate the nutrient and sediment concentrations throughout different hydrographs. Additionally, I am studying the effects of hyporheic flow in fine sediment deposition mechanics, which could be a factor that influences the streambed sediment composition, hence the nutrient loads released during high flow events. 

Hopefully I will be using this class to process time series of temperature data at different subtrate depths as a tracer for hyporheic flux direction and magnitude. Additionally, I will have to conduct some signal processing on hydrophone recordings to correlate certain sound signals to transported grain sizes during a hydrograph.  

My goals for the semester: 
1. Enhance my coding skills *by being more proficient in troubleshooting, reading library documentation and getting used to backing my code up on GitHub*
2. Learn about new packages applied to earth and environmental sciences *and further apply it to my own research in the future*
3. Connect with everyone else and have a better taste of collaborative work while using Git
